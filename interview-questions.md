# ASSESSMENT 4: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely on your own, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is the virtual DOM in React?

Your answer: Not sure

Researched answer: In React there is a lightweight, virtual representation of the actual DOM called the Virtual DOM. It's a JavaScript object that mirrors the structure of the actual DOM.

2. Ruby has an implicit return. What does that mean? 

Your answer:Implicit return means that the method in ruby will automatically return a value without a return keyword.

Researched answer: The function or in Ruby's case the method immediately ends its execution and sends the return value back to the calling environment.

3. Compare and contrast JavaScript and Ruby. What are three things they have in common and what are three differences?

Your answer: They are both dynamically typed, they both are OOP languages, and are both easily read, more so Ruby. Differences between the two JavaScript uses camelCase and Ruby uses snake-case.

Researched answer: Both are interpreted languages, meaning they don't require compilation into machine code before execution. Both are dynamically typed, you don't need to specify data types explicity when declaring variables, and both support OOP. They support the creation and manipulation of objects and allow you to use classes for building complex data structures and applications. 
Differences: Javascript is used for web development, Ruby is a versatile language used for a range of applications including web development, system administration, and scripting. Javascript syntax is C-style and often considered less forgiving, Ruby syntax is more human friendly and is ofen desscribed as elegant and easy to read.
Javascript is known for its single-threaded, event driven nature, while Ruby traditionally used threads for concurrency, but it has since adopted an event drive, non blocking model similar to javascript.

4. STRETCH: What is a version manager?

Your answer: I dont know.

Researched answer: A version manager enables users to create a special file within the project that captures the required version of the language.

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

1. Ruby blocks: A block is the same thing as a method, but it does not belong to an object. Block can accept arguments and returns a value. Block does not have their own name.

2. RSpec: RSpec is used to write automated tests for Ruby code, specifically for testing the behavior of classes, methods, and other code components.

3. Test-driven development: TDD is a software development practice that emphasizes writing tests before writing the actual code.
